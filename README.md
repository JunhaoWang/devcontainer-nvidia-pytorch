# Dev Container NVIDIA Torch

That is an example of how to setup a NVIDIA DevContainer with GPU Support for PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

- Docker engine (and setup .wslconfig to use more cores and memory than default)
- NVIDIA driver for the graphic card
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (which is already included in Windowsâ€™ Docker Desktop; Linux users have to install it)
- VS Code with DevContainer extension installed
- Follow the instructions to enable hardware counters profiling presented [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-development-tools-solutions-err_nvgpuctrperm-permission-issue-performance-counters)
  - On windows this involves updating settings on the NVIDIA Control Panel and **rebooting** the computer

## Start the DevContainer
- Clone this repo.
- In VS Code press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to bring up the Command Palette. 
- Enter and find `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. 
- VS Code will download the docker CUDA image, run the install dependencies, and open the directory in DevContainer.
- The DevContainer then runs `nvidia-smi` to show what GPU can be seen by the container.

## Navigate to an example folder

Use `make` to compile and profile the code.

```bash
cd examples/gemm-cuda
make # to compile (or run) the (python) code
make ncu # to profile the kernel
make nsys # to profile the whole application
```

## Visualize the profiling results

Install nsight-sys and nsight-compute on your local machine and open the files generated in `examples/<app>/prof` folder



## Setup details

We leverage the NVIDIA CUDA image, which contains CUDA and PyTorch dependencies installed. See the [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) for more details.


### Additional Python packages
The file `.devcontainer/requirements.txt` contains all third party Python packages you wish to install. Modify the list as you like and uncoment the "updateContentCommand" line in [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) to install the packages.

```
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
tensorflow
autokeras
ipykernel
regex
```
